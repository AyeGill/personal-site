A list of some projects/topics I'm thinking about. Please feel free to contact me with any thoughts on these, references to existing work, your own work, etc.

- Work out Galatius-Kupers-Randall--Williams' theory of cellular $E_k$-algebras in the infinity-categorical setting.
- Develop a good substitution for first-order logic in the setting of higher categories.
  - Let $X_{CRingSp}$ be the classifying $\infty$-pretopos for connective $E_\infty$ ring spectra, and let $X_{CRing}$ be the classifying $\infty$-pretopos for commutative rings. Then $\pi_0$ determines a map $X_{CRing} \to X_{CRingSp}$. What can we say about this map? Can we find some good description of, say, the cofiber?
- Develop analysis in the setting of pyknotic/condensed sets.
  - The ambition here is that a lot of things could be done internally.
- Develop probability theory from the complexity-theoretical viewpoint.
- Learn more about previous approaches to categorical probability
  - Kurtz' theorem describes how a discrete Markov process is approximated by an ODE as $N \to \infty$ (this is a type of central limit theorem). Can we find a "categorical" CLT which recovers this?
- Studying machine learning using categorical methods.
  - The connection to game theory, sketched out in the final section of [From open learners to open games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08666), seems very exciting.
  - I am also reading [Compositional deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08292)
