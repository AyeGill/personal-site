Some stuff about sheaves and higher geometry
--------------------------------------------

`\index{Sheaf}`{=latex}`\index{Topos}`{=latex} Given some (small)
category $\cl{G}$ of "test spaces" with a grothendieck topology, we get
a topos $Sh(\cl{G})$ of "stacks" that generalize $\cl{G}$. Recall the
*canonical* topology on a category, the largest (strictest) topology
making all representables sheaves. In the case of a (grothendieck)
topos, this has the special property that the sheaves are *all*
representable. We can define a subcategory of $Sh(\cl{G})$, consisting
of those "spaces" that admit a cover of representable sheaves through
"nice" morphisms

1.  If $\cl{G} = FgCRing^{op}$ is the category of finitely generated
    commutative rings, the representable sheaves can be thought of as
    the finite-type affine schemes, and the sheaves admitting a covering
    by open embeddings of affines are the schemes. We say a map
    $F \to G$ of stacks is an open embedding if, for each $U \to G$ with
    $U$ an affine scheme, the pullback $V \to U$ is a map of affine
    schemes which is an open embedding (we can use this schema to define
    other classes of maps). For this reason we generally call the
    representables *affine schemes* and the subcategory *schemes* or
    just spaces.

2.  If $\cl{G} = {\R^n}$, with smooth maps and the natural notion of
    cover, we call $Sh(\cl{G})$ the category of smooth sets. We should
    want a theorem like "smooth sets admitting a (countable) cover of
    affines through open embeddings are precisely the manifolds."

There's a generalization of this to higher categories.
