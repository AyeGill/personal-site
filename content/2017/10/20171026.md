On representable functors to $Grp$
==================================

Suppose $A \in \cl{C}$ is a group object in a category $\cl{C}$ with
products. In other words, we have maps $A^2 \to A$, $1 \to A$ and
$A \to A$, corresponding to multiplication, identity and inversion, and
satisfying the obvious axioms. These maps give natural transformations
$\cl{C}(-,A)^2 \cong \cl{C}(-,A^2) \to \cl{C}(-,A)$, similarly the
others, equipping the sets $\cl{C}(X,A)$ with group structure.
Naturality of these maps imply that the representable maps
$\cl{C}(Y,A) \to \cl{C}(X,A)$ are group homomorphisms, so that
$yA: \cl{C}^{op} \to Set$ factors through the forgetful functor
$Set \to Grp$.

The somewhat surprising thing is that this is all reversible, i.e for
each functor $F: \cl{C}^{op} \to Grp$, so that the composite
$\cl{C}^op \to Grp \to Set$ is representable, there is a unique way to
make the representing object a group object. To see this, consider all
the diagrams $F(A)^2 \overset{\mu_A}{\to} F(A)$ (in sets) defining the
group structure on $F(A)$ (the set). Functoriality implies that the
diagrams like

commute, so that $\mu_A$ is a natural transformation. Hence it comes
from a map $A^2 \to A$, and the relations on the maps $\mu_A$ and the
corresponding natural transformation for the identities and inversions
mean that the maps on $A$ make it a group object.
