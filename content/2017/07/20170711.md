On the continuous function calculus: Letting $\cl{M}$ be the maximal
ideal space of $A[x]$, we can view elements of $A[x]$ as functions
$\cl{M} \to \C$. Under this identification, $x$ becomes a homemorphism
$\Gamma(x) : \cl{M} \to \sigma(x)$. Then given $f : \sigma(x) \to \C$,
we have $\Gamma(f(x)) = \Gamma(\Gamma^{-1}(f)) = f : \cl{M} \to \C$.
Since $\cl{M}$ and $\sigma(x)$ are identified by
$\Gamma(x) : \cl{M} \to \sigma(x)$, we really have
$f(x) = \Gamma^{-1}(f \circ \Gamma(x))$. In other words, under the
$\Gamma$ correspondence, applying $f$ means (post)composing with it.

This also implies that $f(g(x)) = (f \circ g)(x)$, and that
$f(x) = \lambda 1$ if $f \equiv \lambda$.

Remark: the continuous function calculus is some serious deep magic.
