The GNS construction
--------------------

`\index{GNS construction}`{=latex} Any $C^*$-algebra embeds as a
sub-$C^*$-algebra of $B(H)$ for some Hilbert space $H$.

To see this, we consider for each state $\phi$ on $A$ the ideal
$L_\phi = \{x \in A : \phi(x^*x) = 0\}$. Do some analysis to see this is
an ideal. The quotient $A / L_\phi$ becomes a Hilbert space with
$\left<[x],[y]\right> = \phi(x^*y)$ (or maybe the other way), after
taking closure under induced norm. Call this $H_\phi$. Elements of $A$
act on $H_\phi$ by multiplication. The action of $A$ on
$\oplus_{\phi} H_\phi$ is free, norm- and involution-preserving, so
gives embedding of $A$ into $B(\oplus \dots)$.

(Of course you must do some calculations to check that this all works
out. Details in Zhu.)
