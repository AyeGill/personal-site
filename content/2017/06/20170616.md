Grothendieck topologies on finitely presented k-algebras
--------------------------------------------------------

`\index{Algebraic Geometry}`{=latex}`\index{Sheaves}`{=latex}`\index{Grothendieck Topology}`{=latex}`\index{Zariski Site}`{=latex}
Reading *Sheaves in geometry and logic* pages 116-121 (The Zariski
site).

Since (affine, finite) schemes/varieties are dual to finitely generated
k-algebras, it's natural to ask if we can just put a grothendieck
topology on the dual of the category of f.p k-algebras which behaves
somewhat like the Zariski top on normal schemes.

An open cover of the variety $\Spec k[x_1, \dots x_n]/I$, which may as
well consist of distinguished open sets, then amounts to choosing
$f_i \in k[\dots]/I$ so that $\cup D(f_i) = \Spec k[\dots]/I$ - this is
equivalent to $(f_1, \dots, f_m) = (1)$. In this case, the concrete
morphisms into $\Spec \dots$ that we want to think of as covering it are
the maps $\Spec (k[]/I)_{f_i} \hookrightarrow k[]/I$. These are dual to
the canonical maps $k[]/I \to (k[]/I)_{f_i}$.

So we choose as a basis for a grothendieck topology the families of
(duals of) maps of the form $\{A \to A_{f_i}\}_{i\in I}$, where the
$f_i$ generate $A$.

(Will/should probably write out notes on Grothendieck tops and bases in
the future. Not sure I grasp details yet.)

Important diagram
-----------------

A presheaf $P$ on a category with a (grothendieck) topology is a sheaf
iff each triangle like the following, with $S$ a sieve which covers $C$,
an object, admits a unique completion:

with $yC = \Hom(-,C)$.

Details: $S$ is by definition (of being a sieve on $C$) some subfunctor
of $yC$. A natural transformation $S \to P$ is a choice, for each map
$f: D \to C$ in the sieve, of some element in $f^*P(D)$ - in the case of
ordinary topology, some section over $D$. Naturality is the condition
that these things be compatible with precomposition (ie that restriction
maps commute). Then an amalgamation consists of a choice of element in
$P(C)$ which is compatible with all this. This is enough to determine a
natural trans. $yC \to P$ (ie a "restriction" along any map into $yC$).
Key fact here: any $\epsilon: yC \to P$ is determined by
$\epsilon(1_C) \in P(C)$
