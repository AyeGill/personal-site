also worthless.

From $Fun(I,C)$ to $C_{/x}$
---------------------------

If $\cl{C}$ is an $\infty$-cat, and $x$ is an object, we think of
$\cl{C}_{/x}$ as "the category of morphisms with codomain $x$". This
seems like it should be the pullback of this diagram:

That pullback does have the same objects, but different morphisms.

First of all, $1_x : x \to x$ is terminal in the slice category
$\cl{C}_{/x}$. Hence by the remark from yesterday, the domain functor
$Fun_x(\Delta^1, \cl{C}_{/x}) \to \cl{C}_{/x}$ is a trivial fibration.
Here the subscript $x$ denotes morphisms with codomain $1_x$. There's
also a map $Fun_x(\Delta^1, \cl{C}_{/x}) \to Fun_x(\Delta^1, \cl{C})$
given by postcomposition with the forgetful functor.

Suppose given a diagram like so:

We claim we can always produce a lift. By the ajunction properties of
$Fun$, this is equivalent to this diagram.

The condition that we land in $Fun_x$ means that resticting the first
map along inclusion of $1$ should produce $1_x \in \cl{C}_{/x}$,
similarly for the other one.

The top map corresponds to a map
$\phi : (\partial\Delta^n \times \Delta^1) \star \Delta^0 \to \cl{C}$ -
composition with the forgetful functor corresponds to restriction to the
first part. In other words, commutativity of this diagram means that the
restriction of $\phi$ to the first join-and admits an extension to
$\Delta^n \times \Delta^1$ - finding a lift means extending this
extension to $(\Delta^n \times \Delta^1)\star \Delta^0$.

Using the fact that the original maps land in $Fun_x$, we can construct
this extension by hand. But it's not clear how to do this in general.
