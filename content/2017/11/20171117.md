Something about functors between fibers
---------------------------------------

If $p: \cl{C \to D}$ is an inner fibration between $\infty$-categories,
the fibers $\cl{C}_x, x \in \cl{D}$ are also $\infty$-categories. We can
ask, under what conditions can we assosiate to a morphism
$x\to y \in \cl{C}$ a functor $\cl{C}_x \to \cl{C}_y$? The answer is
that there should be a sufficient supply of *$p$-coCartesian* morphisms
lifting $x\to y$ - for each object $\tilde{x} \mapsto x$, there should
be a coCartesian lift $\tilde{x} \to \tilde{y}$.

To see this, form the pullback:

Then the fibers over $0$ and $1$ of the left vertical arrow are the
fibers over $x$ and $y$, and by the pullback stability of coCartesian
morphisms (and inner fibrations), the left vertical arrow is a
coCartesian fibration.

Now we can just apply (the dual of) [@LuHiTop; @5.2.1.4], letting the
categorical equivalences be identities.

I remark here that it seems like every way to Rome goes through the
(un)Straightening equivalence - god damnit!
