====================

An interesting observation: If the stabilization functor
$\cl{C} \to Sp(\cl{C})$ is to be thought of as analogous to
$\cl{C} \to Mon_{E_\infty}(\cl{C})$ (for example), then the
"spectrification" of a space should be thought more propely of as the
"free spectrum generated by" the space.
