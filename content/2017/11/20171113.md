==================

By straightening/unstraightening applied to the coCartesian fibration
$\cl{C}^\tensor \to \Fin_*$, a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category is
equivalently a certain kind of functor
$\cl{C}^\tensor : \Fin_* \to \Cat_\infty$. In fact, the requirement is
precisely that the functor
$\prod \cl{C}^\tensor(\rho_i) : \cl{C}^\tensor(\ang{n}) \to \cl{C}^\tensor(\ang{1})^n$
is an equivalence. So in fact, symmetric-monoidal $\infty$-categories
are (cartesian) $\Gamma$-objects in $\Cat_\infty$!
