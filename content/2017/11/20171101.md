=====================

Suppose $\cl{C}$ is a pointed $\infty$-category. Then we can define maps
$0: X \to Y$ for any $X,Y$ by choosing maps $X \to 0 \to Y$ and choosing
a composite. Is this well-defined up to homotopy? In other words, given
this diagram:

with the triangles commutative, can we find a homotopy between $f$ and
$g$? Yes: choose any arrow $0 \to 0'$. By initiality and terminality,
both the resulting triangles commute. These two, and the left origingal
triangle, make up an inner horn. The fourth face of a filler witnesses
$f$ as the composition of the right maps - hence it must be homotopic to
$g$.
