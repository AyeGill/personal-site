Overview
--------

We discuss three models of $(\infty,1)$-categories: Topological
categories (that is, $\cl{CG}$-categories), simplicial categories and
$\infty$-categories or quasicategories. Note that both topological and
simplicial categories are regarded "up to homotopy", although the
precise notion of "weak equivalence" between such categories is somewhat
subtle. The main point is that the mapping spaces in such a category
should be thought of simply as representations of some (weak) homotopy
type. We will start by defining the basic objects and their notions of
equivalence. Then we will describe the comparison theory between them,
simplicial nerves and underlying simplicial category. We will prove
results to the effect that, regarding these objects as merely techincal
devices for understanding the "homotopy category", they are equivalent.
The main reference for these notes is [@LuHiTop].
