We can
approach the idea of trivial algebras/$E_k$-homology by trying to define
an intermediate step of *Trivial algebras with distinguished
$0$-morphisms*.

Define $Triv^+$ to be the following category:

1.  The objects of $Triv^+$ are pairs $(\braket{n}, Z)$, where
    $Z \subseteq \braket{n}^\circ$. We think of the point in $Z$ as
    being sent to zero, as opposed to the underlying object of the
    algebra.

2.  A morphism $f: (\braket{n}, Z) \to (\braket{m}, Z')$ consists of

    -   A pointed function $f: \braket{n} \to \braket{m}$

    -   A subset $T \subseteq \braket{m}^\circ$ (those coordinates where
        the morphism equals/factors over zero).

    -   Such that $Z' \cup f(Z) \subseteq T$

    -   Such that for $i\in Z$, $f\inv(\{f(i)\})$ is a singleton (we
        never define operations like $X \tensor 0 \to X$). (This may be
        unnecessary)?

    -   And moreover so that, for $i \notin T, i \neq *$, $f\inv(i)$ is
        a singleton. (We only ever define zero operations and
        identities.

3.  Given
    $f,T: (\braket{n},Z) \to (\braket{m},Z'), g,S: (\braket{m},Z') \to (\braket{r},Z'')$,
    the composition is $g\circ f, S \cup g(T)$.

There is an obvious forgetful functor $Triv^+ \to Fin_*$. We also define
functors $Triv \to Triv^+$ and $Fin_*^{surj} \to Triv^+$.

The first just sends $\braket{n}$ to $\braket{n},\emptyset$, and $f$ to
$f,\emptyset$.

The latter sends $\braket{n}$ to $\braket{n},\emptyset$, but sends $f$
to $f,S$ where $S$ consists of those points with non-singleton preimage

Then we guess that these are all well-defined, $Triv^+$ is an operad and
these functors are operad maps.

Let $\cl{C}$ be pointed. Then we define
$\widetilde{\Alg_{Triv^+}(\cl{C})} \subseteq \Alg_{Triv^+}(\cl{C})$ to
be the full subcategory of those algebras where
$$(\braket{1},\braket{1}^\circ) \mapsto 0 \in \cl{C}_{\braket{1}} \simeq \cl{C}$$

Then we have the following conjecture: the composition
$$\widetilde{\Alg_{Triv^+}(\cl{C})} \to \Alg_{Triv^+}(\cl{C}) \to \Alg_{Triv}(\cl{C}) \simeq \cl{C}$$
is an equivalence of $\infty$-categories .
