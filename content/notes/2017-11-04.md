About functorial construction of diagrams
-----------------------------------------

*Note added 2017-11-05:* This is completely wrong, the colimit of a
constant functor is that object, not $0$.

Suppose $0$ is a terminal object of a category $C$. Then we can define a
functor $C \to Fun(\Gamma, C)$, where $\Gamma$ is the category with that
shape, by taking $C$ to this diagram:

The natural transformations (the action on morphisms) are the obvious
ones.

In the setting of quasicategories, it is not so simple. BUT! We can
apply [@LuHiTop] prop 4.3.2.15, in the case where $D' = \Delta^0$,
$C = \Gamma (=N(\Gamma))$, and $C^0$ is the initial object of $\Gamma$.
($D$ is $C$, confusingly). Then the induced functors
$\Gamma^0_{/x} \to C$ are all constant, so admit the colimit $0$. So
$K'$ is just the set of objects in $C$. By the colimit formula for Kan
extensions, we see that any kan extension of $x: \Delta^0 \to C$ to
$\Gamma$ must have terminal objects at the other coordinates. (Since any
two such functors are equivalent, this is even a sufficient criterion
for kan extension-ness). Hence $K$ consists of functors like the ones
pictured above, and a section of the trivial fibration of the theorem
gives us the desired functorial construction.
