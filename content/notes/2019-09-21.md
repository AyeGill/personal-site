## Michael Nielsen's method for reading papers

From [this article](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

- Read paper quickly ("almost skimming"), looking for
    - Most important ideas. "Key techniques I needed to learn about". Maybe what are the questions it's trying to answer and so on.
    - Simple background facts that are useful and easy to understand. "Basic terminology, the rules of Go, so on".
    - Examples from this stage: "What's the size of a Go board?", "Who plays first in Go?" "Where did AlphaGo get its data?", "What are the names of the two main types of NN used by AlphaGo".
- Make several rapid passes (five or six), going deeper and deeper each time.
- Make two thorough passes, really trying to understand the paper.

Total time: A few days, spread over a few weeks.

## Notes from [How To Make a Map of Every Thought You Think](https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/html/doc003.html)

(The title is a bit of a guess, it doesn't seem to be anywhere on the page).

- Use "Maps of contents" instead of tables of contents. More dynamic/flexible. Put related things close to each other.
- Use shorthand/glyphs and a 4color pen.
- Speed lists: for writing down all the simple thoughts *quickly*.
