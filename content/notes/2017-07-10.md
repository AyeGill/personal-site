Spectral theorem and continuous function calculus
-------------------------------------------------

Given a $C^*$-algebra $\cl{A}$ and an element $x\in\cl{A}$, we can ask
for the sub-$C^*$-algebra generated by $x$ (ie the intersection of all
such containing $x$). Denote this $\cl{A}[x]$. (Or in general
$\cl{A}[S]$ for some $S\subset A$). If $x$ is normal (ie $xx^* = x^*x$),
then this is commutative. It's the closure of the set of polynomial
expressions in $x$ and $x*$.

Then $\cl{A}[x]$ is a commutative $C^*$-algebra, so
$\Gamma : \cl{A}[x] \to C(\cl{M_{A[x]}})$ is an iso. We have the
following theorem

The map $\cl{M} \to \sigma(x)$ given by $\phi \mapsto \phi(x)$ is a
homeomorphism. Furthermore, identifying $C(\cl{M}$ with $C(\sigma(x))$,
if $y = p(x,x*) \in \cl{A}[x]$, we have $\Gamma(y)(z) = p(z,z*)$ (for
some polynomial in two variables $p$).

This allows us to "evaluate" continuous functions of the spectrum "at
x", in a way that does the reasonable thing for polynomials and is
continuous. This is called the continuous function calculus.
