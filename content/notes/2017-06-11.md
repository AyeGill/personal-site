Products of simplicial sets
---------------------------

The 2-simplices of
$\Delta^1 \times \Delta^1$ are given by $(s^i(x), s^j(y))$ for some
$i,j \in \{0,1\},\ x,y\in (\Delta^1)_1$. Now if $x=y$ is the unique
nondegenerate $1$-simplex in $\Delta^1$, this is degenerate if and only
if $i=j$. So $\Delta^1 \times \Delta^1$ has precisely two nondegenerate
$2$-simplices, as you would expect geometrically. We also see that their
boundaries are as expected.

I think a broader lesson here is that simplicial sets should, as far as
possible, be worked with "formally" - ie the difference between
degenerate and non-degenerate simplices should only be worried about
when we absolutely need geometric intuition to guide us.

Remark on scheme maps
---------------------

Given two spaces $X, Y$, and the rings of
functions $\cl{O}(X), \cl{O}(Y)$, and a map $X \to Y$, we obtain a map
$\cl{O}(Y) \to \cl{O}(X)$.

Now the central idea of algebraic geometry is to reverse this and obtain
$X$ from $\cl{O}(X)$. Hence we want maps of rings $R \to S$ inducing
$\Spec S \to \Spec R$. And we want this to "reverse" the above, ie
thinking of $R,S$ as function on $\Spec R, \Spec S$, we want the
"induced map of functions" $R \to S$ to be the original map.

So given a map $\phi: k^n \to k^m$, there's an induced map
$\{k^m \to k\} \to \{k^n \to k\}$, taking $f(x)$ to $f(\phi(y))$.

We can reverse this: a map of rings
$k[y_1,\dots y_m] \to k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is precisely a choice of
polynomial $f_1$ for each $y_1$. So on the (closed) points of the
schemes, we should have a map of spaces $\phi$ so that precomposition
with $\phi$ sends $y_1$ to $f_1$ - ie
$\phi(x_1,\dots x_m) = (f_1(x_1\dots ), f_2(x_1\dots)\dots)$. This is
precisely what we get if we unwind the definition!
