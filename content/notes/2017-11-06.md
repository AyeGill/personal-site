The correct correspondence between over and arrow categories
------------------------------------------------------------

We've been concerned with defining a functor
$\cl{C}_{/x} \to Fun(\Delta^1, \cl{C})$ for the past few days. The
solution can be found in section 4.2.1 of [@LuHiTop]. We can define an
alternative version of the slice category in terms of $X \diamond Y$
rather than $X \star Y$.

Let $X,Y$ be simplicial sets.
$$X \diamond Y = X \coprod_{X \times Y \times 0} X \times Y \times \Delta^1 \coprod_{X \times Y \times 1} Y$$

In other words, a map out of $X \diamond Y$ is a homotopy between maps
from $X \times Y$, with the requirement that we start at a map that only
depends on $X$, end at one only depending on $Y$.

If we replace $\star$ with $\diamond$ in the definition of
$\cl{C}_{/p}$, we get $\cl{C}^{/p}$. There's a natural map
$X \diamond Y \to X \star Y$, inducing a functor
$\cl{C}_{/p} \to \cl{C}^{/p}$. Lurie proves this to be an equivalence of
$\infty$-cats.

Now, specialize to the case of an object. In other words,
$Y = \Delta^0$. Then simplices $\Delta^n \to \cl{C}^{/x}$ are maps
$\Delta^n \diamond \Delta^0 \to \cl{C}$ "ending" at $x$. Such a map, by
the universal property of pushout, is precisely a map
$\Delta^n \times \Delta^1 \to \cl{C}$ ending at a degenerate $n$-simplex
$x$. This describes a natural simplicial subset of
$Fun(\Delta^1,\cl{C})$, corresponding to morphisms ending in $x$. The
map we have been looking for is
$\cl{C}_{/x} \to \cl{C}^{/x} \hookrightarrow Fun(\Delta^1,\cl{C})$
