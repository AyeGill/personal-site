$\Omega$-spectra from $\Sigma$-spectra
--------------------------------------

-   An $\Omega$-spectrum is a sequence of spaces $X_n$, along with
    homeomorphisms $X_{n} \cong \Omega X_{n+1}$

-   A $\Sigma$-spectrum is a sequence of spaces $X_n$, along with maps
    $\Sigma X_n \to X_{n+1}$ (equivalently $X_n \to \Omega_{n+1}$).

The latter definition is *not* standard.

Given a $\Sigma$-spectrum $X$, define
$(\omega X)_k = \hocolim_{n} \Omega^nX_{n+k}$ - the maps in the
sequential homotopy colimit are given by $X_{n+k} \to \Omega_{n+k+1}$,
the adjoint maps of the structure maps of the spectrum. Now the maps
$X_n \to \Omega X_{n+1}$ induce maps
$(\omega X)_k \to \Omega(\omega X)_{k+1}$ - since these maps are just
given by shifting the index of the colimit by $1$, this is a
homeomorphism (at least for consistent choices of models for the
homotopy colimit). Hence $\omega X$ is an $\Omega$-spectrum.

Furthermore, if $X$ is already an $\Omega$-spectrum, $\omega X \simeq X$
(this is levelwise homotopy equivalence compatible with the structure
maps).

This definition is from [@SegCatCoh]
