How to define the indecomposables functor:

Let us first list some desiderata:

(1) We want a natural transformation of functors
    $$\CAlg(\Pr^{L,\tensor}_{pt})^{op} \to \Pr^R$$ Here the left-hand
    side consists of presentably symmetric monoidal categories, with
    pointed underlying category, and right adjoints of symmetric
    monoidal left adjoints. (Note that these always admit a canonical
    lax symmetric monoidal structure). The right-hand side consists of
    presentable $\infty$-categories and right adjoints.

    We want a natural transformation $$Triv: U \to \CAlg^{nu}(-)$$
    between the underlying $\infty$-category functor and the category of
    nonunital commutative algebras functor.

(2) We want the underlying object of $Triv_{\cl{C}}X$ to be (naturally
    equivalent to) $X$.

(3) We want the multiplication on $Triv_{\cl{C}}X$ to be zero.

Look at HA.3.2.3 for this. Try to construct by noting that, on free
algebras, $QFX = X$, and everything is a sifted colimit of such.

Gijs conjectures that the space of natural transformations
$\alpha: U \to CAlg^{nu}(-)$ equipped with an equivalence
$U \alpha \simeq Id$ is contractible. We could describe this as the
space of triangles

in $\Fun(CAlg(Pr^{L,\tensor})^{op}, Pr^R)$. (Here the unlabeled arrow is
the only one allowed to vary)
