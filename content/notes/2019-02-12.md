Further discussion on $p$-local things, chromatic theory, so on.

Recall the map $$\rho: Spc(\Sp) \to Spec(\cl{Z})$$ given by
$$\rho(P) = \{f \in \Z = \Hom(\S,\S) \mid cofib(f) \notin P$$

We want to ask about $\rho\inv(\{(p)\})$. In other words, we want to
identify a property of thick ideals $P$ so that
$cofib(\cdot p) \notin P$ for some specific prime $P$, but
$cofib(\cdot q) \in P$ for other primes.

Note that by classification theorem, all thick ideals are kernels of
some functor $- \tensor X_P$. Then
$$cofib(f) \in P \Leftrightarrow f \tensor X_p \text{ an equivalence} \Leftrightarrow
X_P \labelto{\cdot p} X_P \text{an equivalence}$$

In other words, for $K$ a spectrum, the thick ideal given by the kernel
of $- \tensor K$ is sent to $(p)$ if and only if $p$ is *NOT* invertible
in $K$.

This means that all the chromatic primes $K(p,n)$ lie "inside"
$p$-localization, in the sense that they invert all non-$p$ primes (but
may invert even more morphisms).

Let $\Alg(h\Sp)$ denote the category of homotopy ring spectra (not the
same as $h\Alg(\Sp)$, homotopy category of ring spectra.)

$MU \in \Alg(h\Sp)$ admits a complex orientation, and as such is initial
among complex oriented ring spectra, i.e the map from $\Hom(MU,E)$ to
complex orientations on $E$ given by pushing forward the universal one
is a bijection.

The map $L \to \pi_*(MU)$ classifying the formal group law associated to
the universal complex orientation, is an isomorphism.

The idea of $p$-localization seems to make sense in any stable . It is
simply localization with respect to the maps $I \labelto{\cdot q} I$
(right?).

Fix a prime $p$, and consider localization with regards to the Moore
spectrum $S\Z_{(p)}$. Equivalent:

(a) $X$ is $p$-local.

(b) $X$ is local with regards to the multiplication map
    $\S \labelto{\cdot q} \S$, for each prime $q \neq p$.

The maps $\cdot q$ are all $p$-local equivalences, so (a) implies (b).

Now, suppose (b) holds. This means that
$map(\S,X) \labelto{\cdot q} map(\S,X)$ is an equivalence, but this can
be identified with $X \labelto{\cdot q} X$. In other words, $X$ is
$q$-divisible for each $q \neq p$. Then so is $X$s homotopy groups. (The
rest of the theorem is the fact that locality can be checked on homotopy
groups)

We have this exact sequence
$$\pi_*X \tensor \Z_{(p)} \to \pi_*(X \tensor S\Z_{(p)}) \to Tor(\Z_{(p)}, \pi_{*-1}X)$$
just as yesterday, this implies $X \to X \tensor \Z_{(p)}$ is an
equivalence.

Alternatively, we may try to show that $X \to X \tensor S\Z_{(p)}$ is
also a localization for the second class of morphisms. Clearly
$S\Z_{(p)}$ is also local for these morphisms. Not clear that one can
easily show that $\S \to S\Z_{(p)}$ is localization for these morphisms.

One idea might be to characterize $S \to S\Z_{(p)}$ as the universal
ring map inverting each $q \neq p$. This is probably true, since $H\Z$
tensored with this thing should be the dg-localization of $\Z$ at $(p)$,
which is just $\Z_{(p)}$, so it seems it should be $S\Z/(p)$.

It follows that for other rings, $S_{(p)}$-algebra structure exist if
and only if $1$ is uniquely $p$-divisible, i.e. if $\pi_*E$ is uniquely
$p$-divisible. From this it follows that
$S_{(p)} \to S_{(p)} \tensor_S S_{(p)}$ is an equivalence (by comparing
universal properties), so that tensoring with $S_{(p)}$ is a smashing
localization.

An object $X$ is local in this sense iff $X$ admits a $S_{(p)}$-module
structure, which is true if and only if the unique ring map
$S \to Center(End(X))$ factors over $S_{(p)}$. By definition, this
requires that the indentity (and hence all maps in the center) is
uniquely $q$-divisible for each $q \neq p$, which is precisely the
statement that $q: X \to X$ is an isomorphism (since multiplication by
$q$ in $End(X)$ is postcomposition with this map).

Ring discussion may be unnecessary.

Let $\S \to L_{(p)}\S$ be initial among maps from $\S$ to $(p)$-local
spectra. Let $\Z \to L_{(p)}\Z$ in $D(\Z)$ be the analogous thing. Note
that $H\Z \tensor - : \Sp \to D(\Z)$ maps $\S$ into $\Z$, and takes
multiplication by $p$ to multiplication by $p$. Hence there's a
factorization as below:

Going around this diagram in each direction with $\S$, we get that
$L_p\Z \simeq H\Z \tensor L_p(\S)$. On the other hand, it's a basic
matter of algebra that $L_p\Z = \Z_{(p)}$, so that $L_p(\S)$ is a Moore
spectrum for $\Z_{(p)}$.

Given a sufficiently nice stable, presentably symmetric monoidal
$\infty$-category $\cl{C}$, we obtain a diagram

![](/images/e69f7d2554750ba777a0f08c7fd1481af37fbce6.svg)

Here $\cl{C}_{(p)}$ is the localization at the maps $I \labelto{q} I$
for $q \neq p$ a prime.

Note that this localization can be identified with tensoring with
$F(\S_{(p)})$ (this works for any smashing localization).

A subcategory is thick if it's stable under finite limits and colimits.
If $\cl{C}^\omega$ is generated under finite colimits by $I$, then any
thick subcategory is a $\tensor$-ideal.

Consider $\Sp \to \cl{C}$, restricting $\Sp^\omega \to \cl{C}^\omega$.
This gives a map $Spc(\cl{C}^\omega) \to Spc(\Sp^\omega)$, simply by
taking the inverse image of each prime. However, we can also try to
define a map in the other direction by taking the kernel of $K(p,n)$ to
the kernel of $F(K(p,n))$.
