## Cognitive Science Notes 6

I read about neural network. Much of what I read was familiar, but some was new.
They are presented as an alternative to the physical system hypothesis.
I'm note sure how plausible this is - surely the activation levels in a layer of neurons is a "physical pattern" which can serve as a symbol.
But the contrast with language-like models of cognition is well appreciated.

One interesting note of something I was not familiar with: the notion of *competitive NN*.
These are a form of unsupervised learner, using *Hebbian Learning*. The basic concept is that, when a neuron in layer $n$ fires,
and this results in a connected neuron in layer $n+1$ firing, their connection is strengthened.
(This is inspired by a plausible model of how *biological* neurons learn).
This is combined with an inhibitory connection between the *output* neurons - one output neuron firing inhibits the firing of the others.
The result is supposedly that the each output neuron learns a class of "similar" inputs on which to fire - an unsupervised partitioning (clustering) of the input space.
