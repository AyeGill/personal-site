How the behaviour on free modules determines $\tensor$ on $\rm Ab$
------------------------------------------------------------------

Let $FX$ be the free abelian group on a set $X$. There's a natural (in
both variables) isomorphism $FX \tensor FY \to F(X\times Y)$. This and
the fact that $\tensor$ has a right adjoint (even that it preserves
colimits) determines $\tensor$.

First, let $A$ be an arbitrary abelian group, and let $FX \to FY \to A$
be a cofiber sequence. Then
$FZ \tensor FX \to FZ \tensor FY \to FZ \tensor A$ is also a cofiber
sequence, which we can replace by
$F(Z \times X) \to F(Z \times Y) \to FZ \tensor A$. This means
$FX \tensor -$ is determined for any set $X$. (Applying this to a map of
cofiber sequences inducing a given map $A\to B$ determines the action on
morphisms). Now repeating the above argument, this is enough to
determine $\tensor$ completely.
