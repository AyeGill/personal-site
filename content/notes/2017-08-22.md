Given a category, we can try to equip it with a Grothendieck topology by
saying that a family of morphisms $X_i \to Y$ is a covering family if we
have gluing and identity for the set of *morphisms* to some object $Z$ -
this could also be described as the strictest topology making the
representables sheaves.

To spell this out, this means that if

commutes for each $i$, then $f=g$, and if we're given a family
$X_i \to Z$ so that

![](/images/5a73023fa567106b2e8a7c7c167c5625c09972b3.svg)

commutes for each pair $i,j$, then this induced a map $Y\to Z$ making
everything commute.

For instance, if our category is the poset of open sets in a space, this
recovers the usual notion of covering (interestingly, we don't need to
reference the points at all.)
