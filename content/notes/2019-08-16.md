Paul Christiano: ["AlphaGo Zero takes a policy-improvement operator(like
MCTS[^1]) and converges towards a fix-point of
it"](https://ai-alignment.com/alphago-zero-and-capability-amplification-ede767bb8446)

Can we model this type of "iterate towards a fixpoint" thing using
trace-like constructions in category theory?

The way to get a cospan-algebra from a hypergraph category is to note
that cospans define maps in hypergraph categories. Should write more on
this when we get to that paper.
