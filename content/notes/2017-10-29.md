Homology theories
-----------------

Recall the discussion on Thursday, 2017-10-26. Suppose we have a
cohomology theory $(H^n)_{n \geq 0} : Top_* \to Ab$. Brown
representability guarantees the existence of a sequence of spaces $E_n$
and natural isomorphisms $yE_n \overset{\sim}{\to} H^n$ - ismorphisms
*of pointed sets*. But of course $H^n$ has a given abelian group
structure, and $E_n$ will turn out to be a loop space, so these sets
each have a given abelian group structure. Now the question is: do they
agree (i.e, is the above map an iso of groups)?

The answer turns out to be yes. In essence, the question is the
following: $[\Sigma X, E_{n+1}]$ has the structure of an abelian group
in two ways: as $H^{n+1}(\Sigma X) \simeq H^n(X)$ and as a set of the
form $[\Sigma X, Y]$. Do they agree? In other words, we have two maps
$H^{n+1}(\Sigma X) \oplus H^{n+1}(\Sigma X) \to H^{n+1}(\Sigma X)$,
determing each group operation. The one corresponding to $\Sigma$ is
induced by the map $\Sigma X \to \Sigma X \wedge \Sigma X$. First of
all, if we choose a constant map $f$ on one component of the wedge, the
conposition is homotopic to $f$. So we see that
$(f,0) \mapsto f, (0,g) \mapsto g$. Since this map is a *group
homomorphism* (being induced by a map of spaces!), it equals
$(f,g) \mapsto f+g$, so the two agree.

Annoyingly, this argument seems rather contingent on the precise notion
of abelian groups.
