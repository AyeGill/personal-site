## Sketch of supermemo

Each card has a difficulty factor and a delay (time to next review), as well as a "last review" (or equivalently, a "next review" date) associated to it.
On each review, multiply the delay by the difficulty factor, and update difficulty factor based on how the review was.

## Naive method

Keep note of factor, delay and next date on cards. Sort by next date, review, update each day.
This probably requires a sticky note or equivalent on each card - quite impractical.

## Ideas

Track difficulty in discrete categories - say five different categories, move up or down or stay on each update.
Can track next time by position, if you have *a lot* of dividers.
Maybe you can let time get less precise as it passes? But then how do you sort into days as it approaches?
Cut difficulty factor?
