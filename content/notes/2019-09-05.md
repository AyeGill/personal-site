In the current models of learning agents as open games, the "dynamics" arise from iterated play. This doesn't necessarily seem correct - this is like reinforcement learning? But e.g. GAN is something we think of as supervised learning.

[Logical induction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03543.pdf): A way of assigning probabilities to logical statements over time is a *logical inductor* if it can't be exploited by a polynomial-time algorithm.
