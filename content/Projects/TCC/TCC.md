Topological Cyclic Homology {#Proj:Proj02}
===========================

Overview
--------

*17-11-06:* Jonas (McCandless) has roped me into maybe attending the
*Arbeitsgemeinschaft*(workshop) on Topological Cyclic Homology. This is
about some pretty advanced homotopy theoretic machinery, developed with
full use of $\infty$-categorical language. I'll put my notes about this
development here.

### Things I need to understand

1.  Definitely a solid working knowledge of stable $\infty$-categories
    (and thus of normal ones). This is what brought on the discussion of
    the past few days (17-11-04, 05) on how to construct certain
    diagrams functorially.

2.  I should probably develop a decent understanding of Nikolaus-Scholze
    on topological cyclic homology - at least, this paper seems like a
    good place to start.

3.  What's up with the norm map $X_{hG} \to X^{hG}$? The construction in
    Nikolaus-Scholze is like five layers of abstract nonsense.

4.  Segal conjecture?
