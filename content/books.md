title: My recommended math books, and the problem of recommending math books.

I'm sometimes asked (as are, probably, most other graduate students) which textbooks to read about various mathematical topics.
The askers are usually undergraduates who are interested in studying something within the morass of topology, category theory, algebra, and so on.
A typical conversation may go something like this:

Person: If I want to learn about $TOPIC, what should I read?

Me: Well, I learned it from "A", and I liked that well enough.

P: Fair enough.

Me: But it's not perfect or anything. Later I read "B", and I think I like that better. But of course by that point I already knew something about $TOPIC, so that doesn't mean it's good for newcomers..

P: Okay..

Me: Then there's also "C", which is the classical text.. but that's probably better as a reference than to learn from...

And so on, and so forth. The result is that the other person leaves with a list of approximately every textbook on the subject which I have ever opened, which is not particularly useful.
Of course, the tradeoff is that people want and need different things from books. Of course experts need something different from novices (a good reference vs a good textbook),
but different novices need different types of exposition too, and the problem of matching a person to a book in this manner is so difficult you may as well just try different books until one of them works.

My experience with the various math-related parts of the internet mirrors this. Posting "can someone recommend a good introduction to category theory" to reddit or twitter is a good way to find a list of every halfway decent introduction to category theory written in the last 30 years (and a few older ones, probably including Mac Lane itself), but not much else.

## Recommendations
The following list should be interpreted in light of the preceding discussion.
I have erred on the side of recommending a single good book rather than two books of which one is good and one is okay.
In the (common) case that I don't think my recommendations would outperform a google search for "math textbook $TOPIC" or a reddit thread on r/math, I have omitted my recommendations.

This list is also heavily slanted towards my own interests (e.g. it contains more recommendations for topology books than real analysis books).

All these recommendations are for the advanced undergraduate/beginning graduate level.

### Unqualified recommendations

- Point-set topology: *Topology* by J. Munkres. This is not my favorite math book, but in my view it is the "most perfect" one. Point-set topology is the only subject where I *never* feel a need to discuss other books. I will add the remark that the second part, on algebraic topology, is not as good (although it is by no means bad).

### Recommendations

- Algebraic topology: *Algebraic Topology* by A. Hatcher, or *A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology* by J. P. May. Hatcher is probably more pedagogic and leans towards a geometric viewpoint, where May is more concise and leans towards an algebraic viewpoint.
- Basic category theory: *Categories in Context* by E. Riehl. There are many introductions to category theory, but I think this is the best one. It has a wonderful number of examples.
- *Concrete Mathematics* by R. L. Graham, D. E. Knuth and O. Patashnik. It won't tell you anything about category theory or PDEs, but it will definitely make you more complete as a mathematician.
- *How to solve it* by G. Polya. Separate from the other books here in that it will be most beneficial to a beginning undergraduate or even high school student (or perhaps even more, to a high school *teacher*). But it's too important for me to leave it off this list.
