We add to the desiderata from yesterday:

There should be a natural equivalence
$$\tilde{B}^{E_k}(-) \simeq S^k \smash Q^{E_k}(-)$$ (Obviously this
determines $Q$ in the stable setting.) This thing on the RHS is given in
terms of the *canonical* tensoring of $C_*$ over pointed spaces - we
could also write it as $$\Sigma^kQ^{E_k}(-)$$

We should have natural transformations $$Q^{E_k} \to Q^{E_{k+1}}$$ of
functors $Alg_{E_{k+1}}^{nu}C_* \to C_*$. These might come from a
commutative diagram involving Triv?
