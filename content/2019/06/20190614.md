==================

`\index{Logic, Dynamics, Philosophical, Geometry}`{=latex} In algebraic
geometry, the closed sets are the solution sets of polynomial equations.
This means if an polynomial equation holds on a set of points, it also
holds in their closure. (Applied i.e in Gathmann Ex 9.15)

In logic, the collection of *first-order statements* enjoy a
*compactness* property: if a first-order statement holds for all finite
models of a theory, it holds for all models in general. And if it holds
for each model $M_i$, it holds for their ultraproduct $\int M_i d\mu$ as
well.

Given some sort of dynamical process (discrete or continuous), we may
often ask for *invariants*, properties that retain their (possibly
Boolean) value as the system develops. An invariant carves out some sort
of "closed" or "inescapable" subset of state-space.
