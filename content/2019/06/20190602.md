`\index{condensed, pyknotic}`{=latex} Note about the *condensed sets* of
Scholze(+Dustin). In *condensed mathematics*, Scholze claims that when
defined on extremely disconnected spaces (i.e those compact hausdorff
$P$ where every surjection $P' \to P$ splits), the "sheaf condition"
disappears, i.e a functor $T: \{\mathrm{extr. disc.}\}\op \to \cl{C}$ is
a sheaf just if it preserves products (i.e maps coproducts to products.)
