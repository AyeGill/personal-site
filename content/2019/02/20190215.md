Higher categorical logic according to Lurie

$\Stone$ is the category of Stone spaces, regarded as a full subcategory
of topological spaces.

$\Stone^{fr}$ is the full subcategory generated by the point
$\{\ast\} =: \ast$ under all coproducts. Specifically, it is the
collection of spaces $\beta I$ where $I$ is a discrete set.

An *ultra-* is a locally Cartesian fibration
$$\pi: \cl{E}\to \Stone^{fr}$$ satisfying:

(a) Let $I$ be a set. For each $i \in I$, the inclusion
    $\{i\} \into \beta I$ induces a map
    $$\cl{E}_{\beta I} \to \cl{E}_\{i\} \simeq \cl{E}_\ast$$ These maps
    exhibit an equivalence $$\cl{E}_{\beta I} \to \prod_I \cl{E}_\ast$$

(b) Suppose given $f: E \to E'$ and $g: E' \to E''$ in $\cl{E}$, both
    locally Cartesian, with the property that
    $\pi(f): \pi(E) \to \pi(E')$ preserves isolated points. Then
    $g \circ f$ is also locally Cartesian.

We regard $\cl{E}_\ast$ as the underlying of the ultra-.

Given two
ultra-$$\pi: \cl{E} \to \Stone^{fr}, \pi' : \cl{E}' \to \Stone^{fr},$$
an *ultrafunctor* $\pi \to \pi'$ consists of a functor
$F: \cl{E} \to \cl{E}'$ with the properties:

1.  $\pi = \pi' \circ F$

2.  $F$ preserves locally Cartesian morphisms.

The full subcategory of
$\Fun(\cl{E},\cl{E}')^{op}\times_{\Fun(\cl{E},\Stone^{fr})} \{\pi\}$ is
referred to as the of ultrafunctors. (Note the dual). We denote this
$\Fun^{Ult}$.

Given an ultrafilter $\cl{F} \in \beta I$, obviously the ultraproduct
functor $$\cl{E}_*^I \to \cl{E}_*$$ is given by
$$\cl{E}_*^I \simeq \cl{E}_{\beta I} \to \cl{E}_{\{\cl{F}\}} = \cl{E}_*$$

If $\cl{C},\cl{C}'$ are small bounded $\infty$-pretopoi, we have
$$\Fun^{pretop}(\cl{C},\cl{C}') \simeq \Fun^{Ult}(Mod(\cl{C}),Mod(\cl{C}'))$$

Is there a useful conceptualization of the chromatic thing in this
setting? Instead of taking ultraproducts of `\icats`{=latex}, should be
be taking ultraproducts of rings?

$$\Stone_\cl{C} \to \Stone$$ should probably be defined as the
simplicial set over $\Stone$ so that, given
$\sigma: \Delta^n \to \Stone$, we have
$$\Hom_\sigma(\Delta^n,\Stone_\cl{C}) = \Hom_{\Fun(\Delta^n, \operatorname{PreTop})}(\delta \cl{C},Shv(-) \circ \sigma)$$
In other words, an $n$-simplex in $\Stone_\cl{C}$ lying over sigma is
given by a cone on the $n$-simplex $$s \mapsto Shv(\sigma(s))$$ in the
category of $\infty$-pretopoi.

In this definition, a map
$$(X, \cl{O}_X: \cl{C} \to Shv(X)) \to (Y, \cl{O}_Y: \cl{C} \to Shv(Y))$$
is a map $f: X \to Y$ an a natural *ismorphism* rendering the diagram

![](de8cf3aba7ddf3b5424dd947b40e42f3078342af.svg)

commutative. But maybe it should just be a natural transformation?

What about left and right ultrafunctors in this setting?

The categorical ultrastructure on an `\icat`{=latex}?
