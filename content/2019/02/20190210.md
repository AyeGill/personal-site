==================

According to nLab, the $\Z/(p)$-acyclic spectra are precisely the
$\not \{p\}$-local ones. Note that this means what we want it to, i.e
local with respect to $\Z[p\inv]$. This equivalence can probably be
derived from the fact that $p$-local is equivalent to multiplication by
$p$ being an isomorphism on the homology/homotopy, and the KÃ¼nneth
formula (this should be UCT, probably.)

By the mod-$p$ Whitehead theorem, the $\Z/p$-equivalences and the $\Z_p$
(p-adic) equivalences are the same. Hence $\Z/p$-localization and
$\Z_p$-localization is the same,
