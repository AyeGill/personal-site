====================

Another approach to categorical probability could be categories enriched
in convex spaces (or spaces with means, whatever.)

For instance, there should be a map $G(\Hom(X,GY)) \to \Hom(X,GY)$,
corresponding to choosing a random map, then applying it.

This is a consequence of the fact that there is a map.
$$GX \times GY \to G(X \times Y)$$ sending a pair of distributions to
the independent one. This is a section of the obvious thing
$G(X \times Y) \to GX \times GY$. which we may call "marginalization".

Convex/mean structure: map $GX \to X$. Could we go back on this and say
that a probability distribution is a map
$\mu: \operatorname{Conv}(X) \to X$?

Suppose e.g. that $X$ is compact hausdorff. Then to give a distribution,
we must give a map $C(X) \to \C$ (with certain properties). It suffices
to define it for functions $f: X \to \R_{\geq 0}$. Let such an $f$ be
given. Also let a $\mu$ as above be given. We wish to use $\mu$, so we
will have to construct a mean structure on $X$. So let another
probability distribution on $X$ be given, say $\nu$. We may integrate
$f$ along $\nu$, producing a point in $[0,\infty)$. Not clear how to
proceed from here.

Analogy: A group structure on $S$ is a map from words in $S$ to $S$. But
we could also say that a word in $S$ is *something that you can evaluate
if you have a group structure*
