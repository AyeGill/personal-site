To prove that the second
derivative of the identity is $S^{-1}$, with trivial action, we are
reduced to showing that the natural map
$\fib(X \wedge Y \to X \times Y) \to \Omega Q(X \smash Y)$ is the
multilinearization of the former functor. It's more or less clear that
the latter is multilinear, but not clear why it's universal. Goodwillie
says it follows from the fact that, if $X,Y$ are $k$-connected, this map
is $3k$-connected.

This follows from proposition 1.6 (see definition 1.2). But need to make
this work with bilinearity?

And also need to understand *why* map is $3k$-connected.

We are now thinking about calculating the first derivative of
$F = \Sigma^\infty\Omega^\infty: \Sp \to \Sp$. The claim is that
$F \to 1_{\Sp}$ is the excisive approximation, i.e that the map
$$\colim_n \Omega^n\Sigma^\infty\Omega^\infty\Sigma^n X \to X$$ is an
equivalence for each spectrum $X$.

Consider the map $\Sigma^\infty\Omega^\infty X \to X$. We think this is
an equivalence after applying $\Omega^\infty$. To see this, note that
the composition

$$\Omega^\infty\Sigma^\infty\Omega^\infty \to \Omega^\infty \to \Omega^\infty\Sigma^\infty\Omega^\infty$$
must be the identity by the triangle inequality. But this only gives a
splitting, not a full inverse.
