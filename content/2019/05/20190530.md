Could one analyze a Bayesian network by topological methods? Thinking of
a complex with a vertex for each variable, and a face for each
dependence (I think these are called *factors*?).

Problem with this is, implications are in the wrong direction - if
$A,B,C$ are *pairwise* dependent, this is the *strongest* statement we
can make about their dependence - it is not implies by them being
dependent as a trio.

In fact, the number of possible "types of dependence" which can exist
between three (or more) variables is enormously complex. One can both
have $A,C$ dependent conditional on $B$ (so $A,C$ independent, but if we
fix $B$ they become dependent), and also $A,C$ dependent, but if we fix
$B$ they become independent (their dependence is "moderated" by $B$).

But it seems worthy to study this sort of thing more - the question of
figuring out which relationships "factor through" intermediate
variables, and which don't, seems like an important question of
statistics.

Let us consider generating three normally distributed variables $X,Y,Z$,
and let $A = X+Y, B=Y+Z, C = X+Z$. Then $A,B,C$ are pairwise positively
correlated, but if we fix any one of them, this correlation between the
other two disappears.
