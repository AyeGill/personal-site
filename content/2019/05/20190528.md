A description of dendroidal sets
--------------------------------

Dendroidal sets provide a model for operads or $\infty$-operads. The
idea is to consider a category $\Omega$ of *trees*, which are thought of
as *presentations* of certain operads. Then a (pre) sheaf
$A: \Omega\op \to \Set$ is an object which can be "consistently probed"
by these operads, i.e for each tree $T$ we can ask for $A(T)$, which we
think of as $\Map_{\mathrm{Opd}}(T,A)$. For instance, the tree

![](2a514cdddf3d2debf0d241b9bda10e937ff2e748.svg)

Presents "the free operad with one tenary operation". Hence
$\Map_{\mathrm{Opd}}(T,A)$ detects the set of tenary operations in $A$.

The notion of tree can be defined in different ways. The key is that it
generates a simple type of operad, so it has a collection of colors, and
certain generating operations between the colors. One calls it a tree
because the relationship between these things is suitable acyclic.

A *tree* is a finite partially ordered set $(X,\leq)$, as well as a
subset $L \subset X$ consisting of maximal elements, which we call the
*leaves* of the tree. The set must have a bottom element, which we call
the *root*. Moreover, for each $e\in X$, the set
$\{a \in X \mid a \leq e\}$ must be linearly ordered by $\leq$.

The elements of the set are the colors. For each color $e$, we consider
the set $in(e)$ of *direct sucessors*, i.e those elements which are
minimal in $\{e' > e\}$. Then the operad presented by this tree has an
operation $in(e) \to e$. (Of note here is the fact that the operations
go in the opposite direction of the order). The exception to this is the
leaves, which have no operations into them. In other words, the function
of the set of leaves is to distinguish those maximal elements which
receive no operations, from those which receive a single nullary
operation.

The example tree depicted above has four elements, $r,a,b,c$, with the
obvious relations between them.

For every $n$, we have the *linear tree* $L_n$, given by
$(X,\leq) = [n]$ and $n$ as a leaf. This corresponds to an operad with
$n+1$ colors, and only $n$ unary operations.

For $n$, we also have the *corolla tree* $C_n$, given by
$X = \{r, l_1, \dots l_n\}$, $l_k \geq r$ for each $k$, and no relations
between the $l_k$. We let each of the $l_k$ be a leaf - this corresponds
to an operad with $n+1$ colors, and a single $n$-ary operation.

The assignment $[n] \mapsto L_n$ given an embedding
$\Delta \into \Omega$. Thinking of simplices as the building blocks of
($\infty$) categories, we can think of dendroidal sets as being
augmented by the addition of the corolla trees, allowing higher-arity
morphisms.

Noncommutative geometry
-----------------------

Consider the graph

![](5af53526058d9461a3a22bab53d82c761985230f.svg)

Associated in a natural way to $[n]$. Then the graph $C^*$ algebra of
this thing, which is the universal $C^*$ algebra

-   With generators $q_1, \dots q_{n+1}$

-   All of them positive

-   So that $\sum q_i =1$.

The abelianization of this is *isomorphic* to $C(\Delta^n)$.

The compact Hausdorff space corresponding to this commutative $C^*$
algebra is the universal space with a positive, $n+1$-term partition of
unity. It's clear that
$\{(x_i) \in \R^{n+1} \mid x_i \geq 0, \sum_i x_i = 1\} = \Delta^n$,
equipped with the restriction of the coordinate functions as the
partition, has this universal property - given a space $X$ and a
partition $\phi_i : X \to \R$, the unique map $X \to \Delta^n$ is simply
given by $x \mapsto (\phi_i(x))$.

This leads to the idea of viewing the noncommutative graph $C^*$ algebra
as a *noncommutative simplex*. This is all coming from [@Mah15].

Note that we get noncommutative face maps (by sending some $q_i$ to
zero) and degeneracy maps (by skipping $q_i$ when including the
$n$-simplex in the $n+1$-simplex).

Inspired by this, we can think of giving a commutative $C^*$-algebra
with generators $x_i$ and some relations defining a space in the
following way: each generator $x_i$ is a (complex) coordinate of the
space, and the relations determine a subspace. For instance the
universal commutative $C^*$-algebra generated by two unitaries $U,V$ is
the torus, with $U,V: T \to \C$ being given by the coordinate
projections into $S^1 \subseteq \C$. Then the "noncommutativity" of a
noncommutative space is a noncommutativity of *coordinates*.

Questions:`\index{Question}`{=latex}

-   Can one use the noncommutative simplex to develop a good
    noncommutative singular homology?

-   Or even a good noncommutative homotopy theory? How?

-   How can one describe the noncommutative sphere?

The noncommutative sphere, viewed as a noncommutative version of
$\partial \Delta^n$, might have the following universal property: maps
into it (so $C^*$ maps out of it) are precisely those maps into
$\Delta^n$ so that at least one coordinate is zero at each point.
Commutatively, we could express this as the relation $\prod q_i = 0$ -
but this is not a well-defined thing absent commutativity.

We could also say that the noncommutative $n$-sphere is universal on
$n+1$ self-adjoint generators, $q_1, \dots q_{n+1}$, such that
$\sum q_i^2 = 1$.
