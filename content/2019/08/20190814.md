=====================

Hedges [@Hedges19] has annoyingly/luckily beaten me to many of my ideas
about the connections between open games and leaners. In particular, he
spotted the GAN connection. I think this paper has some really central
ideas.

Skimmed through [@Wu19]. I didn't see anything particularly interesting.

There is a difference between the categorical view on learning as above,
and in [@Gavranovic19](which I am still reading). In the former, we
think about *composition of learning algorithms* - in the latter, it is
more about encoding invariants of the target function.
