In thinking about open games and open agents, it might be worth it to
revisit the idea, somewhat implicit in Hedges' approach, that the
best-response relation is not to be thought of as dynamics. That is, the
elements of $X$ are not really observations which might accrue over
time, but one-time "ways the world might be". Then the way of getting an
agent who updates their strategy (a learner) is to augment this with
some dynamics.
