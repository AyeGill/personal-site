About [@HH19].

The paper is about an alternative to string diagrams for monoidal categories: *Brick diagrams*.

An example pretty much says it all:

![A brick diagram](/images/HH19-brick-diag.png)

The advantage of this approach, over an actual string diagram, is that it seems much more amenable to representation on a computer.
In particular, the authors talk about desiring a *compiler*, which given such a diagram, tells you how to actually interpret it in a monoidal category.

It seems like a representation would be pretty simple.
The basic desideratum of "binary composibility" - that the diagram actually be interpretable in a monoidal category - means the geometry can be optained by recursive binary decomposition. Keeping track of the edge labels (the objects), if that's necessary, may make things a little trickier, but it should still be relatively simple.

A basic idea (if we don't care about type soundness) would be something like this:
```haskell
    {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}
    type MLabel = (String, Int, Int) -- Label, width, height
    data Brick :: * where
        Block :: MLabel -> Brick
        (.||.) :: Brick -> Brick -> Brick -- Horizontal composition - f .||. g means what it looks like.
        (.//.) :: Brick -> Brick -> Brick -- Vertical composition, f .//. g means stick f on top of g.
```
Then you would define "safe" combinators which fail if the dimensions don't add up. A sound version of this would carry around the dimensions in the type.
Another approach to soundness would be to fix a meaning for undefined compositions - for instance, "padding with the unit" in a precise way.
This approach doesn't keep track of the edge labels.
