The equivalence of the categories of Giry-algebras and super convex spaces
==========================================================================

We define the set $\Omega$ of countable partitions of $1$ as
$$\Omega = \{\alpha = (\alpha_i)_{i=1}^\infty \mid \sum_i^\infty \alpha_i = 1, \alpha_i \in [0,1]\}$$
i.e the set of infinite nonnegative sequences with sum $1$.

The equivalence of the categories of Giry-algebras and super convex
spaces An $\Omega$-algebras is a set $A$ equipped with a map
$\Omega \times A^\bN \to A$, written as
$((\alpha_i), (a_i)) \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^\infty \alpha_i a_i$ We say an
$\Omega$-algebra is a *super convex space* if it satisfies:

1.  $\sum_{i=1}^\infty \delta_i^j a_i = a_j$

2.  $\sum_{i=1}^\infty \alpha_i \sum_{j=1}^\infty\beta_j^i a_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^\infty (\sum_{j=0}^\infty \alpha_i \beta_j^i) a_i$

(This is the infinitary version of what you would expect from an
ordinary convex space). A map of super convex spaces is simply a map of
sets which commutes with countable convex combinations.

The main result of the paper is that the Giry monad factors as an
adjunction between the categories of measurable spaces and super convex
spaces, and this presents an equivalence between the categories of super
convex spaces and Giry algebras.
