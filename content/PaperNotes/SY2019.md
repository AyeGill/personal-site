title: The $\infty$-categorical Eckmann-Hilton argument
---

In the discrete case, the commutative operad is characterized by having
*singleton* operation spaces, whereas the associative operad has $n!$
$n$-ary operations. $Comm = \Fin_*$, where the maps in $Ass$ has an
additional linear order on each fiber.

In the case of $\infty$-operads:

-   $\E_1 = Ass$ is as before, the space of $n$-ary operations is
    discrete with $n!$ elements.

-   In $\E_2$, the space of $n$-ary operations is *connected*, and the
    space of operations is a classifying space for the $n$th braid
    group. ?

I guess the point is that the little-cubes model is equivalent to a
certain configuration space? Probably,
$\Mul_{\E_k}(\braket{n},\braket{1}) \simeq C_n(I^k)$, where this denotes
the ordered configuration space on $n$ points.

-   $\pi_1\Mul_2(\E_2) \cong \Z$.

-   $\pi_0\Mul_2(\E_1) \cong S^0$ - stable homotopy groups of spheres?.

The point of the "Eckmann-Hilton argument" is that the connectivities
add up when you apply tensor product of operads.
