I want to run an experiment on different ways of learning.
Like many students, I occasionally experiment with different ways of reading, takes notes, reading my notes, etc, and try to figure out what works for me.
However, like most students, I have never done this in a systematic way.
I have never made a concrete plan for which systems to try. I have never made notes on how each system was working.
I have barely even consciously evaluated a system.
I want to change that. I think it is possible for most people, including myself, to do significantly better at learning than they are.
The problem, of course, is to figure out how to do better. I'm not saying this very limited experiment will give me a huge boost, but it is a step in the right direction.


## Material

First, I need a set of things to learn.
I am primarily interested in scholarly/academic learning, so I will focus on that.
Luckily, I have been keeping a note of textbooks which look good or interesting, in areas outside my own.
So it is easy to get the list started:[^1]

- [*Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738), by C. Bishop
- [*Campbell Biology*](https://www.amazon.com/Campbell-Biology-11th-Lisa-Urry/dp/0134093410), by J. B. Reece
- [*Cognitive science: An introduction to the science of the mind*](https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Science-Introduction-Mind-ebook/dp/B00IO0EBIK), by J. L. Berm√∫dez
- [*Thinking in systems*](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557), by D. H. Meadows
- [*Organic Chemistry*](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-Jonathan-Clayden/dp/0199270295/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), by J. Clayden, N. Greeves, S. Warren
- [*A student's guide to Bayesian Statistics*](https://www.amazon.com/Students-Guide-Bayesian-Statistics/dp/1473916364/), by B. Lambert

[^1]: These were mostly sourced from [this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject) discussion on Less Wrong.

Here it is perhaps worth noting that I am a mathematics MSc student[^2] - it seems plausible that this will give me more of an advantage in some areas (say, statistics) than in others (say, biology). This is certainly worth keeping in mind, but it seems unavoidable.

[^2]: In algebraic topology, not statistics

## Methods

Now I need a list of different ways of studying.
Here we need to be careful: adding a lot of modifications between each subject will give me a broader set of information, but will make it harder to distinguish which methods made the difference.
But to begin with, I just list number of possible variations:

- Read the book 
    - for duration $t$ every day
    - or alternatively read for duration $t \times 7$ once a week.
    - Or read a certain amount of book (say $n$ pages, or a chapter) every week or day.
- Attempt to do the reading in one go, or split it up in (say) half-our increments.[^3]
- Produce flashcards
    - Just whenever it feels right.[^4]
    - Or produce a certain number of cards per study session.
    - Do not use flashcards
- Write more longform notes and create a review schedule
    - Or don't do this.
- In books with exercises
    - Skip the exercises
    - Attempt each exercise, then move on to the next section.
    - Do not move on until each exercise has been completed.
    - Write out all your solutions
        - Or don't

[^3]: I normally use 25 min work/5 min break intervals while studying.
[^4]: This is my current approach. By "flashcards" i mean cards for a spaced repetition system.

Some of these interventions are obviously beneficial when interpreted as written - it seems very unlikely that writing longform notes and reviewing them is *bad* for your learning.
The question, of course, is whether these options are *time-effective*.
Hence I decide to allocate a certain fixed amount of time weekly for each subject.
Here again, it seems likely that more time will make the experiment more informative, but of course I only have so much time to spend on this.
Hence a longer timeframe will reduce the number of parrallel studies I can do.

Somewhat arbitrarily, I decide on three courses, of three hours weekly each.
This certainly won't make me an expert anytime soon, but it should give me some progress to think about each week, and the schedule should be manageable.
