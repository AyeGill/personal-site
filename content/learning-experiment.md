I want to run an experiment on different ways of learning.
Like many students, I occasionally experiment with different ways of reading, takes notes, reading my notes, etc, and try to figure out what works for me.
However, like most students, I have never done this in a systematic way.
I have never made a concrete plan for which systems to try. I have never made notes on how each system was working.
I have barely even consciously evaluated a system.
I want to change that. I think it is possible for most people, including myself, to do significantly better at learning than they are.
The problem, of course, is to figure out how to do better. I'm not saying this very limited experiment will give me a huge boost, but it is a step in the right direction.


## Material

First, I need a set of things to learn.
I am primarily interested in scholarly/academic learning, so I will focus on that.
Luckily, I have been keeping a note of textbooks which look good or interesting, in areas outside my own.
So it is easy to get the list started:[^1]

- [*Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738), by C. Bishop
- [*Campbell Biology*](https://www.amazon.com/Campbell-Biology-11th-Lisa-Urry/dp/0134093410), by J. B. Reece et al.[^5]
- [*Cognitive science: An introduction to the science of the mind*](https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Science-Introduction-Mind-ebook/dp/B00IO0EBIK), by J. L. Berm√∫dez
- [*Thinking in systems*](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557), by D. H. Meadows
- [*Organic Chemistry*](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-Jonathan-Clayden/dp/0199270295/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), by J. Clayden, N. Greeves, S. Warren
- [*A student's guide to Bayesian Statistics*](https://www.amazon.com/Students-Guide-Bayesian-Statistics/dp/1473916364/), by B. Lambert

[^1]: These were mostly sourced from [this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject) discussion on Less Wrong.

[^5]: This book has a truly crazy amount of authors.

Here it is perhaps worth noting that I am a mathematics student (MSc)[^2] - it seems plausible that this will give me more of an advantage in some areas (say, statistics) than in others (say, biology). This is certainly worth keeping in mind, but it seems unavoidable.

[^2]: In algebraic topology, not statistics

## Methods

Now I need a list of different ways of studying.
Here we need to be careful: adding a lot of modifications between each subject will give me a broader set of information, but will make it harder to distinguish which methods made the difference.
But to begin with, I just list number of possible variations:

- Read the book 
    - for duration $t$ every day
    - or alternatively read for duration $t \times 7$ once a week.
    - Or read a certain amount of book (say $n$ pages, or a chapter) every week or day.
- Attempt to do the reading in one go, or split it up in (say) half-our increments.[^3]
- Produce flashcards
    - Just whenever it feels right.[^4]
    - Or produce a certain number of cards per study session.
    - Do not use flashcards
- Write more longform notes and create a review schedule, or don't do this.
- In books with exercises:
    - Skip the exercises
    - Attempt each exercise, then move on to the next section.
    - Do not move on until each exercise has been completed.
    - Write out all your solutions
        - Or don't
- Buy or print a physical copy of the book, or read a pdf.
    - If using a physical copy, make notes in the book or don't.

[^3]: I normally use 25 min work/5 min break intervals while studying.
[^4]: This is my current approach. By "flashcards" i mean cards for a spaced repetition system.

Some of these interventions are obviously beneficial when interpreted as written - it seems very unlikely that writing longform notes and reviewing them is *bad* for your learning.
The question, of course, is whether these options are *time-effective*.
Hence I decide to allocate a certain fixed amount of time weekly for each subject.
Here again, it seems likely that more time will make the experiment more informative, but of course I only have so much time to spend on this.
Hence a longer timeframe will reduce the number of parrallel studies I can do.

Somewhat arbitrarily, I decide on three courses, of three hours weekly each.
This certainly won't make me an expert anytime soon, but it should give me some progress to think about each week, and the schedule should be manageable.

## Measurement

What to track? Here are some obvious questions:

- How much time is spent taking notes/making cards each week?
- How good is my recall?
    - To test this, I could go back to the exercises after a certain amount of time (maybe after I've stopped reading) and see how I do.
    - I could also create a quiz for each section as I read it? I would expect flashcards to win this type of test easily.
- How good is my understanding?
    - This could be tested by pulling exercises from other textbooks in the same area and seeing how well I do.
    - Or more subjectively, by writing a blog post about each subject and seeing how much interesting I can say about each field.

I decide to spend an hour with each book before choosing some measurements which make sense.

## Experiment

I'm thinking I will create three sets of methods, and assign each to a book randomly, although I'm uncertain whether to build the methods randomly somehow, or simply make three up.
In the end I decide that each of my three courses will have

- A randomly selected book from the above list
- A random reading schedule, either fime days a week or once a week.
- A random notetaking scheme, either:
    - 10 flashcards a week, distributed as desired.
    - 5 flashcards a week.
    - One longer-form note every week, to be reviewed after one week, then doubling the interval each time.

I decide not to use more variations. However, on the areas I've thought about above, I will fix a decision - so I will read from a .pdf for every course, do all my reading in 25-minute increments, and attempt all the exercises (but don't write out every solution and skip if necessary).
The time spent taking notes (or writing flashcards) will of course be taken from the reading time.

I decide to spend ten minutes with each book on my list to gauge their suitability (I have not opened them before now).
If I randomly pick a book which is extremely boring, or which is 50 pages long, it would mess things up.

### Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning

Seems to be well written. More in the familiar (to me) style of a math textbook.
Also has exercises. Pdf has 758 pages.

### Campbell Biology

My pdf has 1472 pages - I assume this is significantly longer than the others.
Each chapter is divided into "key concepts". This kind of structure might be useful for tracking learning.
It seems to be written in a *really* pedagogical style, almost annoyingly so.
Seems to have a lot of digital supplements(which I lack) - this may be annoying, but they don't seem necessary.
The pdf is linked and bookmarked, which is super nice.
It has some exercises.

### Cognitive science: An introduction to the science of the mind

Pdf has 555 pages. Has exercises, seems well written. Each chapter ends with a "checklist" of key points, which is something which could be useful for tracking.

### Thinking in Systems

Pdf has 235 pages. Doesn't have exercises. Still seems an interesting book, but maybe not what I need here.

### Organic Chemistry

Pdf has 1265 pages. Has exercises online, which I can't access.
My limited prerequisites in chemistry may be a problem, I'm not sure.

### A student's guide to Bayesian statistics

I only managed to track down an epub version.
This makes gauging the length difficult, but it seems short.
However, i see online it has 520 pages.
I find reading in the epub reader fairly irritating.

### Conclusion

In the end, I disqualify *Thinking in systems* and *Organic Chemistry* and decide to select three books at random from the other four. I draw *Cognitive Science*, *Campbell biology* and *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*.

I randomly assign the following methods:

- *Cognitive Science* will be read five times a week, and I will write five flashcards every week.
- *Campbell biology* will be read five times a week, and I will write a long-form note once a week
- *Pattern recognition and Machine learning* will be read once a week, and I will produce ten flashcards

Note that $180 / 5 = 36$, so I need to work on each of the first two books for, say, about half an hour each weekday. Of course this makes using 25-min intervals impractical, so I will probably do it in one go.

Here I encounter an annoying limitation of [todoist](https://todoist.com) - I can't mark something as "to do five times weekly".

On top of this, I will write a weekly progress report reflecting on how each method is working for me.

## Pitfalls and alternatives

It is obvious that the content of each book will have a large effect on the experience, which could easily overshadow the effect of the difference in method.
So it would be dangerous to generalize from just this experiment.
One way out of this would be to look for a number of very similar sources - that might make an interesting followup experiment.
In general, the amount of data gathered here will be far too small to draw any strong conclusions.
More experimentation is needed. Nevertheless, I hope this first step will nudge me in the right direction.

I should have included different ways of reading the text - skimming, then reading in detail, skimming, looking at exercises, then going back for the information necessary to work the exercise.
I may not have had room for this variation, but not thinking of testing it was a failure of creativity. This is something to include in future versions of the experiment.

I also want to make a note that, while I made some decisions randomly, I mostly just decided on a procedure.
I say this to make sure I am not fooling myself with this [attire](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5uZQHpecjn7955faL/p/4Bwr6s9dofvqPWakn) - that the fact that I rolled some dice doesn't trick me into thinking that I am doing some sort of controlled experiment.
