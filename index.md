Welcome to my page.

Currently, I am studying a master's degee (cand.scient) in mathematics at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.math.ku.dk/english).

## Some things I did:

My undergraduate thesis, with the inelegant title "[Localizations in Higher Algebra and Algebraic K-theory](pdfs/bach-projekt.pdf)".
Essentially an account of the main result of [Universality of multiplicative infinite loop space theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4550) by Gepner, Groth, and Nikolaus.
Also contains some material about localizations in $\infty$-categories and symmetric-monoidal $\infty$-categories.
Definitely contains at least some minor errors, possibly some major ones.

A discussion of $E_k$-indecomposables in the language of $\infty$-categories and $\infty$-operads:
[$E_k$-indecomposables and $E_k$-homology](pdfs/Ekroot.pdf).
Very rough at the moment, certain to contain a number of errors.

A note on some ideas of Lurie concerning $\infty$-categorical logic:
[Bounded ultraspaces](pdfs/ultraspaces-essay.pdf). Thanks to Tobias Barthel for putting together the ultraseminar.

I have a few programming projects on [github](https://github.com/AyeGill)

I have compiled a dataset of about 56.000 decklists for the [Commander/EDH](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/commander-format) format for Magic: The Gathering. They were scraped from [mtggoldfish](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/). It's possible the data may need some mild sanitizing.
The set can be found [here](files/decks.zip)
(I was interested in training a neural network on this data, but it never got off the ground).
